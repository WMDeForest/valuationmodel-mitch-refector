    Process song ownership data from uploaded file.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    ownership_file : file object, optional
        The uploaded CSV file containing ownership data
    track_names : list
        List of track names for which to create default ownership entries if no file is provided

    Returns:
    --------
    pandas.DataFrame:
        A DataFrame containing standardized ownership information with columns:
        - 'track_name': Name of the track
        - 'Ownership(%)': Percentage ownership as a decimal (0.0-1.0)
        - 'MLC Claimed(%)': Percentage of mechanical license claims as a decimal (0.0-1.0)
        
        Both percentage values are normalized to decimal format (e.g., 50% â†’ 0.5).
        When no ownership file is provided, defaults to 100% ownership (1.0) and 
        0% MLC claims (0.0) for all tracks in track_names.
